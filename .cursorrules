🚀 Cursor Rules -- Rick & Morty Explorer (React Refactor Edition)
🎯 Project Goal
Refactor a Vanilla JS app into a High-Impact React Application. The UI must resemble a "Citadel Database": technical, sci-fi, and data-heavy, avoiding generic "social media" card layouts.

🎨 Visual Identity: "Multiverse Dossier"
Strict Design Guidelines:

Layout: Horizontal/Rectangular Cards (Dossier style). NO vertical cards.

Aesthetic: Cyber-grunge, dark mode, neon accents, glassmorphism.

Typography:

Headers: Display Font (e.g., Creepster or similar glitchy font).

Data/Specs: Monospace (font-mono) to simulate terminal data.

Color Palette (Tailwind Config):

bg-space-black (#24282f) → Main Background.

text-portal-green (#97ce4c) → Primary Actions, Glows, Active States.

border-toxic-yellow (#e4a788) → Warnings, Highlights.

bg-card-gray (#3c3e44) → Component Backgrounds.

🛠 Tech Stack
Core: React (Vite) + JavaScript/TypeScript.

Styling: Tailwind CSS + clsx/tailwind-merge.

Motion: Framer Motion (Mandatory for entry animations and hover effects).

Icons: lucide-react (Use thin, technical icons).

📐 UI/UX Requirements (The "Wow" Factor)
1. The "Citadel File" Card (Character Component)
Structure: Horizontal layout (flex-row).

Left: Avatar image. Starts Grayscale, becomes Color on hover.

Right: Technical Data (Name, Status, Location, Origin).

Interactions:

Hover triggers a neon glow border (border-portal-green).

Hover reveals a "Access Data" button or extra details.

Status indicator must be a glowing LED dot (Green/Red/Gray).

2. Layout & Navigation
Grid: Responsive Grid that stacks vertically on mobile but expands to 2 or 3 columns on desktop.

Loader: Custom rotating "Portal" SVG (No standard spinners).

Pagination: "Portal Jump" style controls (e.g., "Jump to Dimension [Page]").

🧠 Coding Standards for Cursor
React Architecture
Functional Components: Use const Component = () => {}.

Custom Hooks: Extract logic (e.g., useCharacters, usePagination) separate from UI.

Performance: Use useMemo for filtering lists.

Tailwind Usage
Utility-First: Avoid custom CSS classes unless for complex animations.

Gradients: Use subtle gradients for image overlays (bg-gradient-to-r).

Glassmorphism: Use backdrop-blur-md and bg-opacity for sticky headers/filters.

Animation Strategy
Page Load: Staggered fade-in for list items (items don't appear all at once).

Hover: scale-105 or translate-x for subtle feedback.
